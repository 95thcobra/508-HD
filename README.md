# 508-HD

An open source, clean deob of the runescape client at revision #508.

This will be an ongoing project with the ultimate goal of creating a fully renamed and packaged hd client. 

Obfuscation removed:

Flow,
Counters,
Try catch blocks,
Maths/bitshifts were simplified.

It is notable that there are some areas of the source code that possess dummy variables / parameters. These will be removed eventually.
